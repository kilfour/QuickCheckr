## Conditional Execution
### Checkr Act Carefully When
```csharp

    from thing in Checkr.ActCarefullyWhen("Act", () => counter != 2, () => counter == 3 ? null : new Thing())
    from notNull in Checkr.Expect("Not Null", () => thing.Value != null)
    select Case.Closed;
```
### Checkr Act When
```csharp
    from counter in Checkr.Input("Counter", Fuzzr.Counter("key"))
    from thing in Checkr.ActWhen("Act", () => counter != 2, () => counter == 3 ? null : new Thing())

## Everything Means Less Than Null
### Trackr Get Pool
```csharp
    from one in Trackr.GetPool<int>()
    select Case.Closed;
```

```
## It Is Written, ... But Only Once
In QuickCheckr, the strings you pass to `Trackr.Stashed`, `Checkr.Input`, `Checkr.Act`, etcetera,
are not just pretty captions in a report.

They function as **stable identifiers**.

QuickCheckr uses each key for two distinct purposes:

1. **Reporting:** The key appears in execution traces, minimal fail-cases, and summaries.
2. **Book-keeping:** Internally, the engine uses the same key to label stored values, look up decisions, and coordinate shrinking.

Because of this dual role, **each key may only be written once per relevant scope**.  

If you try to write the same key in the same scope twice or more, using the same Checkr, an exception is thrown.
  
### Checkr Act
- `Checkr.Act`:  
```csharp
    from one in Checkr.Act("reused", () => { })

```
  Throws:  
```text
Key 'reused' is written more than once to the same memory location.
QuickCheckr treats keys as stable identifiers.
Keys must be unique per memory bank.
Reusing a key for multiple write operations makes reports and shrinking ambiguous.
The following Checkrs write to the this bank using the same key:
- 'Checkr.Act'
- 'Checkr.ActCarefully'
```
