## In Pools We Trust

**Pools**  

These let QuickCheckr accumulate multiple objects across executions.  
Where `Stashed` keeps one instance alive, a Pool keeps all created instances, and later actions can pick one at random.  

Pools are not exposed as raw sequences on purpose.
Treating pools as lists leads to scattered .Any() / .Count() checks that tend to become brittle during shrinking.
Instead, pool operations (When, These, ToPool, ...) encapsulate "is this state valid?" so shrinking can replay safely.

- [In Pools We Trust] <= for guide intro
  - An overview of pools and their usage.
  
### Creating a Pool
Pools are created for *a specific type* using:  
```csharp
Trackr.PoolFor<Contact>();
```
```csharp
public record Contact(string Name)
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = Name;
}
```
### Storing things in the Pool
```csharp
from pool in Trackr.PoolFor<Contact>()
from name in Checkr.Input("Name", Fuzzr.String())
from storeName in Trackr.ToPool("Name", new Contact(name))
select Case.Closed;
```
### Using random elements from a Pool
```csharp
    from contactBook in Trackr.Stashed(() => new Rolodex())
    from names in Trackr.PoolFor<Contact>()
    from name in Checkr.Input("Name", NameFuzzr)
    from operations in Checkr.OneOfWhen(
        names.When(a => a.Count() < 10,
            from add in Checkr.Act("Add", () => contactBook.Add(name))
            from trace in Checkr.Trace("Name", () => name)
            from storeName in Trackr.ToPool("Name", new Contact(name))
            select Case.Closed),
        names.When(a => a.Any(),
            from newName in Checkr.Input("New Name", NameFuzzr)
            from pool in Trackr.OneOfPool<Contact>("Contact to update",
                contact =>
                    from trace in Checkr.Trace("Old Name", () => contact.Name)
                    from update in Checkr.Act("Update", () => contactBook.Update(contact.Name, newName))
                    from updatePool in Checkr.Perform(() => contact.Name = newName)
                    select Case.Closed)
            select Case.Closed))
    from count in names.Expect("Count matches", elements => elements.Count() == contactBook.Contacts.Count)
    select Case.Closed;
```
## Conditional Execution
### Checkr Act Carefully When
```csharp
    from counter in Checkr.Input("Counter", Fuzzr.Counter("key"))
    from thing in Checkr.ActCarefullyWhen("Act", () => counter != 2, () => counter == 3 ? null : new Thing())
    from notNull in Checkr.Expect("Not Null", () => thing.Value != null)
    select Case.Closed;
```
### Checkr Act When
```csharp
    from counter in Checkr.Input("Counter", Fuzzr.Counter("key"))
    from thing in Checkr.ActWhen("Act", () => counter != 2, () => counter == 3 ? null : new Thing())
    from notNull in Checkr.Expect("Not Null", () => thing.Value != null)
    select Case.Closed;
```
```csharp
    from counter in Checkr.Input("Counter", Fuzzr.Counter("key"))
    from thing in Checkr.ActWhen("Act", () => counter != 2, Task.FromResult(counter == 3 ? null : new Thing()))
    from notNull in Checkr.Expect("Not Null", () => thing.Value != null)
    select Case.Closed;
```
### Checkr When
```csharp
    from counter in Checkr.Input("Counter", Fuzzr.Counter("key"))
    from thing in Checkr.When(() => counter != 2, Checkr.Act("Act", () => counter == 3 ? null : new Thing()))
    from notNull in Checkr.Expect("Not Null", () => thing.Value != null)
    select Case.Closed;
```
## When Things Go Wrong
### Everything Means Less Than Null
#### Trackr Get Pool
```csharp
    from one in Trackr.GetPool<int>()
    select Case.Closed;
```
  Throws:  
```text
A retrieval attempt was made for a 'Pool' of 'System.Int32', but none was found.
Make sure you created this pool using: 'Trackr.PoolFor<T>()'.
```
#### Trackr To Pool
```csharp
    from one in Trackr.ToPool("answer", 42)
    select Case.Closed;
```
  Throws:  
```text
A storage attempt was made for a 'Pool' of 'System.Int32' using key 'answer', but no such pool was found.
Make sure you created this pool using: 'Trackr.PoolFor<T>()'.
```
### It Is Written, ... But Only Once
In QuickCheckr, the strings you pass to `Trackr.Stashed`, `Checkr.Input`, `Checkr.Act`, etcetera,
are not just pretty captions in a report.

They function as **stable identifiers**.

QuickCheckr uses each key for two distinct purposes:

1. **Reporting:** The key appears in execution traces, minimal fail-cases, and summaries.
2. **Book-keeping:** Internally, the engine uses the same key to label stored values, look up decisions, and coordinate shrinking.

Because of this dual role, **each key may only be written once per relevant scope**.  

If you try to write the same key in the same scope twice or more, using the same Checkr, an exception is thrown.
  
#### Checkr Act
```csharp
    from one in Checkr.Act("reused", () => { })
    from two in Checkr.Act("reused", () => { })
    select Case.Closed;
```
  Throws:  
```text
Key 'reused' is written more than once to the same memory location.
QuickCheckr treats keys as stable identifiers.
Keys must be unique per memory bank.
Reusing a key for multiple write operations makes reports and shrinking ambiguous.
The following Checkrs write to the this bank:
- 'Checkr.Act'
- 'Checkr.ActCarefully'
```
#### Checkr Act Carefully

```text
