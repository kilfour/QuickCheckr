# On Shrinking
## Philosophy

QuickCheckr keeps shrinking simple and predictable.  
It never tries to *outsmart* your domain with clever global algorithms.  
Shrinking is purely local and irrelevance-based: if removing a value (or execution) still makes the property fail,
QuickCheckr marks it as *irrelevant*. 
This avoids surprising or *magical* shrink results.  
In rare circumstances (for instance, symmetric cases where everything collapses),
you can guide the process by configuring a *stand-in* value (e.g. Trackr.Substitute<int>(-1)),
which helps QuickCheckr distinguish roles without adding complexity.
  
## Execution Shrinking
This is the first step in QuickCheckr shrinking.  
The following simple example fails on the third execution.  
```csharp
    from counter in Checkr.Input("counter", Fuzzr.Counter("counter"))
    from spec in Checkr.Spec("Counter does not equal 3", () => counter != 3)
    select Case.Closed;
```

Execution 1: counter = 1  
Execution 2: counter = 2  
Execution 3: counter = 3  (Fails)  

During execution shrinking the values from counter are not regenerated, but retrieved from the previous run.
So the ExecutionShrinker retries the run with the same values, but tries to remove executions, one by one.  
If the run still fails, the execution is not deemed relevant for the failure and is removed.  

So after *Execution Shrinking*, the result is:

------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    ExampleTest
 Location:                Docs\H_OnShrinking\A_ExecutionShrinking\ExecutionShrinking.cs:53:1
 Original failing run:    3 executions
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 2 shrinks)
 Seed:                    669391953
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed:
   - Input: counter = 3
 ============================================
  !! Spec Failed: Counter does not equal 3
 ============================================
 Passed Specs
 - Counter does not equal 3: 2x
 ------------------------------------------------------------
```
## Input Shrinking
This is the next step in QuickCheckr shrinking and the most complex one.  
QuickCheckr shrinking tries to remove inputs, one by one, to find a minimal failing case.  
The following simple example has one input but always fails.  
```csharp
    from irrelevant in Checkr.Input("Irrelevant Input", Fuzzr.Int())
    from spec in Checkr.Spec("Always Fails", () => false)
    select Case.Closed;
```
Input shrinking reruns the failing execution and prunes inputs whose values don't affect the failure.

So, in the previous example, after *Input Shrinking*, the result is:
  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    Example
 Location:                Docs\H_OnShrinking\C_InputShrinking\InputShrinking.cs:37:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 1 shrink)
 Seed:                    165641598
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed
 ================================
  !! Spec Failed: Always Fails
 ================================
```
Another example, slightly trickier.  
```csharp
    from one in Checkr.Input("Input One", Fuzzr.Int())
    from two in Checkr.Input("Input Two", Fuzzr.Int())
    from three in Checkr.Input("Input Three", Fuzzr.Int())
    from result in Checkr.Act("Result", () => one + three)
    from spec in Checkr.Spec("Should not be 42", () => result != 42)
    select Case.Closed;
```
As you can see from the test definition, two inputs are involved in a possible failure.

QuickCheckr correctly identifies the relevant inputs.

Result:

 Location:                Docs\H_OnShrinking\C_InputShrinking\InputShrinking.cs:78:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 1 shrink)
 Seed:                    231122398
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Result
   - Input: Input One = 12
   - Input: Input Three = 30
 ====================================
  !! Spec Failed: Should not be 42
 ====================================
```
### Collections
#### Removing Irrelevant Items
When shrinking collections, QuickCheckr does not attempt to rewrite or regenerate the list.
Instead, it removes items one by one, replaying the run each time to test whether the removed element was relevant for the failure.

This means that if only some elements in a list contribute to the failing condition, QuickCheckr will aggressively trim the rest away. The result is a minimal list containing only the values that still trigger the failure, even if the original list was large or noisy.

Consider a test that forbids the value `7`:  
```csharp
    from listInput in Checkr.Input("List Input", Fuzzr.Int().Many(0, 10))
    from spec in Checkr.Spec("List does not contain 7", () => !listInput.Contains(7))
    from trace in Checkr.Trace("List Input", () => listInput)
    select Case.Closed;
```
Even if the original list was long and varied, QuickCheckr isolates the single relevant element:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    Example
 Location:                Docs\H_OnShrinking\C_InputShrinking\B_Collections\TheExamples\A_RemovingIrrelevantItems.cs:26:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 8 shrinks)
 Seed:                    1833095082
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed:
   - Input: List Input = [ 7 ]
   - Trace: List Input = [ 69, 49, 90, 36, 16, 71, 95, 7, 84 ]
 ===========================================
  !! Spec Failed: List does not contain 7
 ===========================================
```
#### Removing Irrelevant Collection
Ofcourse a collection itself is just an input like another, so if it, as a whole,
is irrelevant for the failure, QuickCheckr will remove it.  
```csharp
    from listInput in Checkr.Input("List Input", Fuzzr.Int().Many(0, 10))
    from spec in Checkr.Spec("Always fails", () => false)
    select Case.Closed;
```
```text

 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 1 shrink)
 Seed:                    2014608033
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed
 ================================
  !! Spec Failed: Always fails
 ================================
```
#### Irrelevant Element But List Length Is Not
When shrinking collections, QuickCheckr isolates the structural aspects that contributed to the failure
and leaves irrelevant details untouched. 

In cases like this example where the predicate depends solely on the length of the list,
the individual element values play no role.  
QuickCheckr therefore preserves them as anonymous placeholders (_) and concentrates entirely on reducing the collection's shape:
removing elements, and converging toward the smallest list that still violates the condition.

This yields minimal, focused shrinking artifacts:
the report shows only the structural signal that mattered (here: the list being *too long*),
without introducing noise from element-level changes that could not affect the outcome anyway.  
```csharp
    from list in Checkr.Input("List", Fuzzr.Int().Many(1, 10))
    from trace in Checkr.Trace("Original List", () => list)
    from spec in Checkr.Spec("Length <= 2", () => list.Count() <= 2)
    select Case.Closed;
```
```text

 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 5 shrinks)

 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed:
   - Input: List = [ _, _, _ ]
   - Trace: Original List = [ 12, 45, 56, 18, 31 ]
 ===============================
  !! Spec Failed: Length <= 2
 ===============================
```
## Deliberation Shrinking
### The Model:
```csharp
public class Account
{
    public int Balance { get; private set; } = 0;
    public void Deposit(int amount)
    {
        Balance += amount;
        ApplyFee();
    }
    public void WithDraw(int amount)
    {
        if (amount > Balance) return;
        Balance -= amount;
        ApplyFee();
    }
    private void ApplyFee() => Balance -= 1;
}
```
### The Checkr:
```csharp
    from account in Trackr.Stashed(() => new Account())
    from amount in Checkr.Input("Amount", Fuzzr.Int(1, 5))
    from operations in Checkr.OneOf(
        Checkr.Act("Deposit", () => account.Deposit(amount)),
        Checkr.Act("Withdraw", () => account.WithDraw(amount))
    )
    from noOverdraft in Checkr.Spec("No Overdraft", () => account.Balance >= 0)
    select Case.Closed;
```
### The Configuration:
```csharp
private static CheckrConfig Configure(CheckrConfig config)
    => config with { DeliberationPolicy = (a, b) => a.Verdict!.ExecutionCount < b.Verdict!.ExecutionCount ? a : b };
```
### The Report:
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    RunTest
 Location:                Docs\H_OnShrinking\F_DeliberationShrinking\DeliberationShrinking.cs:47:1
 Original failing run:    2 executions
 Seed:                    1258846520
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Deposit
   - Input: Amount = 2
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Withdraw
   - Input: Amount = 1
 ================================
  !! Spec Failed: No Overdraft
 ================================
 Passed Specs
 - No Overdraft: 1x
 ------------------------------------------------------------
```
Running this test with `100.Runs()` and `10.ExecutionsPerRun()` consistently produces a two execution failure.
