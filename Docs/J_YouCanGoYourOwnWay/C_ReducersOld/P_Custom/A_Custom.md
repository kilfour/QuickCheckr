!! WARNING: **Experimental Feature** !!

> This feature is **experimental**.

**The Checkr:**  
```csharp
from input in Checkr.Input("Input", Fuzzr.Int(), CustomTowardsZero.Reducer())
from expect in Checkr.Expect("Input < 2", () => input < 2)
select Case.Closed;
```

**Reducer:**  
```csharp
public class CustomTowardsZero
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns a reducer which tries to reduce the input to zero.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The reducer will try to reduce the value by one if it is greater than zero,
    /// and increase the value by one if it is less than zero.
    /// </remarks>
    public static Func<Reducer<int>> Reducer() =>
        () => new CustomTowardsZero().Reduce;
    private int lastFailed = 0;
    public Reduction Reduce(ReductionResult result)
    {
        var value = result.ValueAs<int>();
        if (result.Failed)
            lastFailed = value;
        else
            return Reduction.Stop(lastFailed);
        if (value == 0)
            return Reduction.Stop(lastFailed);
        if (value > 0)
            value--;
        else
            value++;
        return Reduction.Next(value);
    }
}
```
