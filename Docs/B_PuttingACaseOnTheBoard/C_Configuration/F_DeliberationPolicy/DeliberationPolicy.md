# Deliberation Policy
Sometimes the shrinker comes up with a *local* minimal fail-case, not *the* minimal fail-case.  
Configuring a *DeliberationPolicy* allows us to instruct the Shrinker to explore the input further in a directed fasion.  

Consider the following model:  
```csharp
public class Account
{
    public int Balance { get; private set; } = 0;
    public void Deposit(int amount)
    {
        Balance += amount;
        ApplyFee();
    }
    public void WithDraw(int amount)
    {
        if (amount > Balance) return;
        Balance -= amount;
        ApplyFee();
    }
    private void ApplyFee() => Balance -= 1;
}
```
It's a simple bank account with a no-overdraft invariant and a fee applied on each transaction.  
We can verify this with the following Checkr:  
```csharp
    from account in Trackr.Stashed(() => new Account())
    from amount in Checkr.Input("Amount", Fuzzr.Int(1, 10))
    from operations in Checkr.OneOf(
        Checkr.Act("Deposit", () => account.Deposit(amount)),
        Checkr.Act("Withdraw", () => account.WithDraw(amount))
    )
    from noOverdraft in Checkr.Expect("No Overdraft", () => account.Balance >= 0)
    select Case.Closed;
```
Now if we run this we might get something like this:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    RunTest
 Location:                Docs\B_PuttingACaseOnTheBoard\C_Configuration\F_DeliberationPolicy\DeliberationShrinking.cs:67:1
 Original failing run:    3 executions
 Seed:                    1920827676
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Deposit
   - Input: Amount = 8
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Withdraw
   - Input: Amount = 1
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Withdraw
   - Input: Amount = 5
 =======================================
  !! Expectation Failed: No Overdraft
 =======================================
 Passed Expectations
 - No Overdraft: 2x
 ------------------------------------------------------------
```
As you can see, this is a *local* minimal fail-case, but a smaller one exists.  

Let's add a *DeliberationPolicy*, looking for a fail-case with less executions:  
```csharp
private static CheckrConfig Configure(CheckrConfig config)
    => config with { DeliberationPolicy = Protocol.DeliberationPolicy.MinimumExecutions };
```
Running this test now, with `100.Runs()` and `10.ExecutionsPerRun()` consistently produces a two execution failure.  
```text

 Location:                Docs\B_PuttingACaseOnTheBoard\C_Configuration\F_DeliberationPolicy\DeliberationShrinking.cs:113:1
 Original failing run:    2 executions
 Seed:                    1362685676

  Executed: Deposit
   - Input: Amount = 2
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: Withdraw
   - Input: Amount = 1
 =======================================
  !! Expectation Failed: No Overdraft

 - No Overdraft: 1x
 ------------------------------------------------------------
```
The following predefined policies are available
- `DeliberationPolicy.MinimumExecutions`
- `DeliberationPolicy.MinimumShrinkCount`
- `DeliberationPolicy.MaximumShrinkCount`
- `DeliberationPolicy.MinimumWarnings`

See the documentation for [*Deliberation Shrinking*][DeliberationShrinking] for more examples and usage of these policies.

It is also possible to define a custom policy, but this is an ...
