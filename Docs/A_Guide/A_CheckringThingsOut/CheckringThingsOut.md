# Checkr-ing Things Out
[Guide][Guide] | [Next][TheStashRunsAndExecutions]  
  
A *Checkr* describes a sequence of steps that QuickCheckr will execute repeatedly.
Each run goes through the script from top to bottom: generating inputs, performing actions, checking expectations, and collecting diagnostics.
If any execution fails, QuickCheckr shrinks it to the smallest, easiest-to-understand failing case.  
## First Expectation
Let's start by having a look at the simplest possible Checkr:  
```csharp
public class MinimalCheckr
{
    [Fact]
    public void RunTest()
        => Checkr.Expect("Always true", () => true).Run();
}
```
Congratulations! You've just checked something out. The test passes and now we know that `true` is always `true`.

So what happens if try to do the opposite?  
```csharp
Checkr.Expect("Always true", () => false);
```
The test fails and QuickCheckr produces the following report:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    Run_ExpectAlwaysFalse
 Location:                Docs\A_Guide\A_CheckringThingsOut\CheckringThingsOut.cs:64:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Seed:                    1642083259
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed
 ======================================
  !! Expectation Failed: Always true
 ======================================
```

The report shows a run summary containing :
* Test: Name of the test executing the Checkr.
* Location: Source code Location of the test executing the Checkr.
* Original failing run: Number of executions executed during the run.
* The minimal fail-case: In this toyest of examples it *only* specifies that an execution happened.
* Failure details: Why the run failed in the first place.
* Seed: The seed used to generate the failing run.  
  You can use this to reproduce the failing run reliably, by calling run with the seed passed in.  
```csharp
checkr.Run(1642083259);
```
## Gathering Input
Let's add an input to the Checkr, and change our expectation:  
```csharp
var check =
    from input in Checkr.Input("Input", Fuzzr.Int())
    from expect in Checkr.Expect("Input /= 42", () => input != 42)
    select Case.Closed;
```

*Note:* `Case.Closed` marks the end of the Checkr script.
A Checkr is just a LINQ expression that evaluates step by step,
and the final select clause must return a value representing the completed case.
`Case.Closed` simply signals "this case finished successfully, there are no more steps".

QuickCheckr relies on the [`QuickFuzzr`](https://github.com/kilfour/QuickFuzzr/blob/main/README.md) library to generate inputs.

`Fuzzr.Int()` generates a random integer between 1 and 100, so this test will fail, on average, once every hundred times.  
Not ideal, so let's up the run number, like so:  
```csharp
check.Run(200.Runs())
```
Now the test fails consistently:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    AddingAnInput
 Location:                Docs\A_Guide\A_CheckringThingsOut\CheckringThingsOut.cs:90:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Seed:                    127648209
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed:
   - Input: Input = 42
 ======================================
  !! Expectation Failed: Input /= 42
 ======================================
```
As you can see the input is now included in the report *minimal fail-case*,
this is because QuickCheckr judged the input to be relevant to the failure.  
So, if we add another input to the Checkr, one which does not influence the failure:  
```csharp
var check =
    from input in Checkr.Input("Input", Fuzzr.Int())
    from irrelevant in Checkr.Input("Irrelevant Input", Fuzzr.Int())
    from expect in Checkr.Expect("Input /= 42", () => input != 42)
    select Case.Closed;
```
The following happens:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    AddingAnotherInput
 Location:                Docs\A_Guide\A_CheckringThingsOut\CheckringThingsOut.cs:132:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 1 shrink)
 Seed:                    127648209
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed:
   - Input: Input = 42
 ======================================
  !! Expectation Failed: Input /= 42
 ======================================
```
That's basically the same thing as before, because QuickCheckr does not report irrelevant inputs.  
## Not Without a Trace
QuickCheckr's *shrinking* can sometimes seem magical. Not a problem in this simple test,
but when you are writing a more complex test, it is always helpful to see what's really going on.

QuickCheckr is built with transparency and discoverability as a first class concern:  
```csharp
var check =
    from input in Checkr.Input("Input", Fuzzr.Int())
    from irrelevant in Checkr.Input("Irrelevant Input", Fuzzr.Int())
    from expect in Checkr.Expect("Input /= 42", () => input != 42)
    from trace in Checkr.Trace("Irrelevant Input", () => irrelevant)
    select Case.Closed;
```
By adding a `Checkr.Trace` to the `LINQ` chain, we get the following report:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    NotWithoutATrace
 Location:                Docs\A_Guide\A_CheckringThingsOut\CheckringThingsOut.cs:169:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 1 shrink)
 Seed:                    769641533
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed:
   - Input: Input            = 42
   - Trace: Irrelevant Input = 47
 ======================================
  !! Expectation Failed: Input /= 42
 ======================================
```
## Time to Act!
Testing inputs is fun and all, but really, we want to test some kind of behaviour, right?  
```csharp
var check =
    from one in Checkr.Input("One", Fuzzr.Int())
    from two in Checkr.Input("Two", Fuzzr.Int())
    from three in Checkr.Input("Three", Fuzzr.Int())
    from sum in Checkr.Act("One plus Three", () => one + three)
    from expect in Checkr.Expect("Sum /= 42", () => sum != 42)
    select Case.Closed;
```
Still a trivial example, but it shows how you can use `Checkr.Act` to start mutating things.  
And here's the report:  
```text
------------------------------------------------------------
 Test:                    TimeToAct
 Location:                Docs\A_Guide\A_CheckringThingsOut\CheckringThingsOut.cs:209:1
 Original failing run:    1 execution
 Minimal failing case:    1 execution (after 1 shrink)
 Seed:                    1642083259
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  Executed: One plus Three
   - Input: One   = 24
   - Input: Three = 18
 ====================================
  !! Expectation Failed: Sum /= 42
 ====================================
```
As demonstrated, the name of the executed action is included in the report, as well as the relevant inputs.
