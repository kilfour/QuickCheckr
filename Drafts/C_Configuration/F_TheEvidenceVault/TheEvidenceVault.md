# The Evidence Vault
QuickCheckr can be configured to persist the results of a failed test run.  
```csharp
private static CheckrConfig Configure(CheckrConfig config)
    => config with { FileAs = "MyQuickCheckrTest" };
```
Above configuration will write the resulting report of a failing run to a `report.qr` file in a folder relative to the solution root:  
```csharp
.quickcheckr\MyQuickCheckrTest\report.qr
```
In addition a sub folder is created containing the evidence vault files:  
```csharp
.quickcheckr\MyQuickCheckrTest\vault\evidence.qv
```
```csharp
.quickcheckr\MyQuickCheckrTest\vault\evidence-log.ql
```

- `evidence.qv` contains a list of all failing seeds, whenever a test fails, the seed is added to this file.
- `evidence-log.ql` is a append only log of all evidence vault actions.  
## Reviewing the Cold Cases
Once an evidence vault exists the seeds therein contained can be reviewed.  
This is done by calling `ReviewColdCases` on the Checkr instance, passing in the same configuration used to create the evidence vault.  
```csharp
checkr.ReviewColdCases(Configure);
```
It is advised to *Dry* out the configuration as is shown at the top of this chapter, in order to avoid code drift.  
This will create a report per seed in the evidence file and a log of all evidence vault actions.
  
- For every failing seed the report will look like the by now familiar failure report.  
- For every passing seed the report will only contain a list of passed specs.
