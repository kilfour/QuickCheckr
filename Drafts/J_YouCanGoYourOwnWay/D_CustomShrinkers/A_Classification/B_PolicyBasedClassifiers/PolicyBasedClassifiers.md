# Policy-based Classifiers
  
## Keep
`Try.Keep` explicitly marks an execution as relevant and worth preserving during shrinking.
In most scenarios this is not strictly necessary, as QuickCheckr will naturally retain behaviour that contributes to failure.
`Try.Keep` mainly exists for completeness and for rare performance-tuning cases where you want to prevent the shrinker from exploring removals you already know are pointless.
It also serves as an explicit signal of intent: this step is considered essential evidence.  

**The Checkr:**  
```csharp
from counter in Checkr.Input("counter", Fuzzr.Counter("counter"))
from thing in Checkr.Input("Null Thing",
    Fuzzr.Constant<Thing>(null!),
    Try.Keep<Thing>())
from expect in Checkr.Expect("counter != 2", () => counter != 2)
select Case.Closed;
```

   - Input: Null Thing = null

```
## None

**The Checkr:**  
```csharp
from counter in Checkr.Input("counter", Fuzzr.Counter("counter"))
from thing in Checkr.Input("Null Thing",
    Fuzzr.Constant<Thing>(null!),
    Try.None<Thing>())
from expect in Checkr.Expect("counter != 2", () => counter != 2)
select Case.Closed;
```
`Try.None` is a custom classifier that explicitly marks an execution as irrelevant and therefore not worth shrinking.
It is primarily a performance tool: when a branch is known not to influence the outcome,
`Try.None` prevents QuickCheckr from wasting time shrinking or re-executing it. 
This can significantly speed up scenarios that involve expensive operations such as WebAPI calls.
It can also be used to suppress unnecessary "all inputs irrelevant" warnings when that irrelevance is intentional and understood.

## Default
`Try.Keep` applies QuickCheckr's normal relevance detection as one strategy within a classifier chain.
Classifiers are executed in succession, so Try.Default can be placed anywhere in the sequence.
If it finds a relevant candidate, the chain stops. Otherwise, the next classifier is attempted.
This makes it possible to combine engine-driven relevance detection with more opinionated strategies such as Try.Values(...)
without hard-coding one as the global default.

```csharp
from counter in Checkr.Input("counter", Fuzzr.Counter("counter"))
from thing in Checkr.Input("Null Thing",
    Fuzzr.Constant<Thing>(null!),
    Try.Default<Thing>())
from expect in Checkr.Expect("counter != 2", () => counter != 2)
select Case.Closed;
```
