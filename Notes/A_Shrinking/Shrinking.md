# Shrinking
Whenever QuickCheckr comes accross a failure during a run, 
it tries to shrink the failing case to find a minimal failing case.

During this process no further executions are performed and no new random values are generated.

QuickCheckr then reports the minimal failing case, 
together with the number of executions, relevant actions and inputs that were required to find it.
